## Overview

This is a login platform built with NestJS. It provides an authentication system with JWT and roles-based authorization, as well as features such as password recovery with Nodemailer and the ability to store data on Amazon S3. The project uses Docker for containerization and Prisma as the ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

The platform consists of the following modules:

- `auth`: module that handles authentication and authorization.
- `user`: module that allows admins to register users and collaborators.
- `shared`: module containing shared resources such as middleware and decorators.

The architecture of the platform follows a clean architecture approach and uses repository pattern to access the database.

The API is documented with Swagger and has unit tests.
